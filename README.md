# PostMortem_WondevWoman_Silver_4th

This game IA project is a 4 weeks challenge that I chose for my project module during my engineer course in France.
I find IA coding very challenging. This experience was very fulfilling and instructive.

Let's take a look at the game rules :
" On a 2D grid, you have to move your characters to score points, while placing obstacles to slow down your opponent.
You need to define a strategy and anticipate the moves of other players in order to pick the best move to play. "
